# To do

The aim of this exercise is to see how you work together with a colleague.  You will not be scored based on the completedness of this exercise.  We're looking at how you understand a problem, interpret requirements and work with others to build a solution.  You do not need to write and plan everything, but we do expect you to assertively drive the conversation with the developer that you are pairing with.

## The problem

Please pair for one hour to create a simple "todo" web application from scratch in your local environment.  Please feel free to use open source libraries, the Internet, and the knowledge of the person you are pairing with.

## Requirements:

 * Enter a "todo" note
 * View and edit their previous todo notes
 * Mark notes as "done"

Do think about:

 * Understanding the problem
 * Working together with your code partner
 * Communicating ideas and solutions with your code partner

Don't worry about:

 * Knowing everything (Google is your friend)
 * Persistance (i.e. reloading the page)
 * Browser support (Just use your favourite browser)
 * Responsive Web Design (or any of the look and feel)

The exercise is timeboxed to 1 hour.
